To ensure service availability, Redis provides replication mechanism to maintain consistent data state across multiple processes.

## Observing Replication with tcpdump

Redis supports a master-slave replication architecture, which is simplified to a single `SLAVEOF` command. 
Let's use this command to analyze the replication mechanism of Redis master and slave.

Start two services on the local machine using redis-server, 
and then observe the interaction between master and slave using tcpdump:
```sh
redis-server --port 6379 --requirepass 123456 # Start master
redis-server --port 6380 --masterauth 123456  # Start slave
tcpdump -t -i lo0 host localhost and port 6379 | awk -F ']' '{print $1"]"$3}'

# Establish a synchronous connection on localhost:6380 to localhost:6379 and enter Full-ReSync phase
localhost.59297 > localhost.6379: Flags [S]
localhost.6379 > localhost.59297: Flags [S.]

```

The replication process can be divided into 3 stages:
- **Full-ReSync** 
- **Command-Propagate**
- **Partical-ReSync**

## PSYNC Command

The original Redis command for synchronization was `SYNC`. 
Each time a slave reconnected, it would generate, transmit, and load the entire RDB snapshot, which consumed a significant amount of machine resources and network bandwidth. 

To address this issue, later versions of Redis added the `PSYNC` command, which supports the following two synchronization modes:


- Full-ReSync
  - The slave connects to the master for the first time.
  - The state difference between the master and slave is too large.

- Partical-ReSync
  - A network jitter causes the synchronization connection to be disconnected and reconnected.
  - The sentinel mechanism causes a change in the master node.



### Data Structure

Let's take a look at the data structures related to `PSYNC` in redisServer:
```c

struct redisServer {
    /*
     *  Node ID and replication offset
     *
     *     If the current node is a master
     *     server.replid is server.runid
     *
     *     If the current node was originally a master and was converted to a slave node
     *     server.replid and server.master_repl_offset are overwritten with the synchronization information of the new master
     *
     *     If the current node was originally a slave and was promoted to a master node
     *     rserver.eplid2 and server.second_replid_offset will record the synchronization information when the current node was a slave
     */
    char runid[CONFIG_RUN_ID_SIZE+1];   /* Current node's runtime ID (changes each time it restarts) */
    char replid[CONFIG_RUN_ID_SIZE+1];  /* The runid of the current master node */
    char replid2[CONFIG_RUN_ID_SIZE+1]; /* The runid of the master node that the current master node was connected to when it was a slave node */
    long long master_repl_offset;   /* Replication offset of the current master node */
    long long second_replid_offset; /* Replication offset of the current master node when it was a slave node */

    /*
     * Replication backlog buffer
     *
     *     The master maintains a single global server.repl_backlog, which is shared by all slave nodes
     *     To reduce memory usage, server.repl_backlog is only created on demand when a slave node is present
     */
    char *repl_backlog;             /* Replication backlog buffer (circular buffer)*/
    long long repl_backlog_size;    /* Backlog size */
    long long repl_backlog_histlen; /* Backlog data length */
    long long repl_backlog_idx;     /* Tail of the backlog buffer (writable position)*/
    long long repl_backlog_off;     /* Synchronization offset (master offset) corresponding to the first byte of the backlog buffer */
}
```
#### **RunID**

Whether master or slave, each Redis server generates a 40-character hexadecimal string as its **runid** when it starts up:

- When a slave requests synchronization for the first time, it saves the `server.runid` returned by the master to `server.replid`
- When a slave requests synchronization again, it sends the previously saved `server.replid` to the master:
  - If this ID is not consistent with the master's current `server.runid`, a full resynchronization must be performed
  - If this ID is consistent with the master's current `server.runid`, a partial synchronization operation can be attempted


#### **Replication Offset**
Both the master and slave maintain a **replication offset** offset in bytes, which can be used to determine whether the state of the master and slave is consistent:

- The master increases its replication offset by N after transmitting N bytes of data to the slave
- When the slave receives N bytes of data from the master, it increases its replication offset by N

When the master receives the offset in the `REPLCONF ACK`, it can use it to determine whether any data sent to the slave has been lost and resends the lost data.


#### **Backlog Buffer**

The master maintains a fixed-length `backlog queue`:
- The master puts commands into this queue when it transmits them to the slave, so some of the latest commands are retained in the buffer
- When a slave issues a synchronization request, and the data which offset behind behind the slave's offset exists in the backlog buffer, the master will perform partial synchronization


## Synchronization Process

### Slave Perspective

After receiving the `SLAVEOF` command, the slave calls replicaofCommand to start master-slave synchronization:

```c
void replicaofCommand(client *c) {
    // ...

    if (!strcasecmp(c->argv[1]->ptr,"no") &&
        !strcasecmp(c->argv[2]->ptr,"one")) {
        if (server.masterhost) { // If the received command is SLAVE NO ONE, then disconnect from the master-slave synchronization
            // ...
        }
    } else { 
        if (c->flags & CLIENT_SLAVE) {
            return; // If the client is already a slave node, then reject this command
        }

        if (server.masterhost && !strcasecmp(server.masterhost,c->argv[1]->ptr) && server.masterport == port) {
            return; // If the master node specified in SLAVEOF has already been connected to, then return directly
        }

        // If no master node has been connected yet, establish a TCP connection according to masterhost and masterport
        // And register the listener function syncWithMaster
    }
}

void syncWithMaster(connection *conn) {
    // Send the PING command to the master node
    if (server.repl_state == REPL_STATE_CONNECTING) {
        server.repl_state = REPL_STATE_RECEIVE_PONG;
        err = sendSynchronousCommand(SYNC_CMD_WRITE,conn,"PING",NULL); // Send the PING command
        // ...
    }

    // Listen to the master's response to the PING command
    if (server.repl_state == REPL_STATE_RECEIVE_PONG) {
        if (err[0] != '+' &&
            strncmp(err,"-NOAUTH",7) != 0 &&
            strncmp(err,"-NOPERM",7) != 0 &&
            strncmp(err,"-ERR operation not permitted",28) != 0)
        {
            goto error;
        }
        server.repl_state = REPL_STATE_SEND_AUTH; // Only handle the master's response values of PONG, NOAUTH, NOPERM
    }

    // According to the master's response value to PING, determine whether authorization is required
    if (server.repl_state == REPL_STATE_SEND_AUTH) {
        if (server.masteruser && server.masterauth) {
            err = sendSynchronousCommand(SYNC_CMD_WRITE,conn,"AUTH",
                                         server.masteruser,server.masterauth,NULL); // Send the AUTH command
            // ...
            server.repl_state = REPL_STATE_RECEIVE_AUTH;
        } else {
            // If the server.masteruser and server.masterauth authorization information is not set, skip AUTH
            server.repl_state = REPL_STATE_SEND_PORT;
        }
    }

    // Omit the following steps:
    // Use the REPLCONF listening-port command to inform the slave's port to the master
    // Use the REPLCONF ip-address command to inform the slave's IP to the master
    // Use the REPLCONF capa eof / capa psync2 command to inform the slave's compatibility (supported features) to the master

     // Start sending PSYNC command
    if (server.repl_state == REPL_STATE_SEND_PSYNC) {
        if (slaveTryPartialResynchronization(conn,0) == PSYNC_WRITE_ERROR) {
            goto write_error;
        }
        server.repl_state = REPL_STATE_RECEIVE_PSYNC;
        return;
    }

    // Read the response to the PSYNC command
    psync_result = slaveTryPartialResynchronization(conn,1);

    // If the response is CONTINUE, skip full synchronization
    if (psync_result == PSYNC_CONTINUE) return;

    // If the return value is PSYNC_FULLRESYNC or PSYNC_NOT_SUPPORTED
    // Start performing full synchronization, register readSyncBulkPayload to listen for RDB file download
    if (connSetReadHandler(conn, readSyncBulkPayload) == C_ERR) {
        // ...
        goto error;
    }

    server.repl_state = REPL_STATE_TRANSFER;

    // ...
}

int slaveTryPartialResynchronization(connection *conn, int read_reply) {
    if (!read_reply) {
        if (server.cached_master) { // server.cached_master not empty, try to perform partial synchronization
            psync_replid = server.cached_master->replid;
        } else {
            psync_replid = "?"; // server.cached_master is empty, only full synchronization can be performed
        }
        //Initiate PSYNC command
        reply = sendSynchronousCommand(SYNC_CMD_WRITE,conn,"PSYNC",psync_replid,psync_offset,NULL);
        // ...
        return PSYNC_WAIT_REPLY;
    }

    reply = sendSynchronousCommand(SYNC_CMD_READ,conn,NULL); // Read PSYNC response

    // If the master responds to FULLRESYNC, full synchronization will be performed directly
    if (!strncmp(reply,"+FULLRESYNC",11)) {

    // master is temporarily unable to process the PSYNC command —> PSYNC_TRY_LATER

}

### Master Perspective

After receiving the `PSYNC` command, the master calls `syncCommand` to start the synchronization process:

```c
void syncCommand(client *c) {
    // Received the PSYNC command sent by the slave
    if (!strcasecmp(c->argv[0]->ptr,"psync")) {
        if (masterTryPartialResynchronization(c) == C_OK) {
            return; // No need for full synchronization, return directly
        }
    }

    // If the code runs to this point, it means that partial synchronization fails and full synchronization is required
    // The master will execute the BGSAVE command to generate a snapshot and transmit it to the slave
    // There are two ways to synchronize the RDB snapshot:
    //     Disk-backed: Generate RDB snapshot files on disk and then transmit them to the slave
    //     Diskless: Write RDB snapshot data directly to the slave socket

}

int masterTryPartialResynchronization(client *c) {
    long long psync_offset; // The latest synchronization offset of this slave
    char *master_replid;    // The runid of the master corresponding to the slave's synchronization offset

    /*
     * The following conditions can avoid full synchronization:
     * 1. The master of the slave's last synchronization is the current instance (network jitter)
     * 2. The slave and the current node were originally slave nodes of the same master, and the current node's synchronization offset second_replid_offset is larger (maintenance restart, failover)
     */

    if (strcasecmp(master_replid, server.replid) &&
       (strcasecmp(master_replid, server.replid2) ||psync_offset > server.second_replid_offset))
    {
        goto need_full_resync; // Does not meet PSYNC conditions, need full synchronization
    }

    /*
     * The following conditions can only perform full synchronization:
     * 1. The master has not initialized the backlog buffer
     * 2. The slave's synchronization offset is behind the backlog buffer
     */
    if (!server.repl_backlog || 
        psync_offset < server.repl_backlog_off ||
        psync_offset > (server.repl_backlog_off + server.repl_backlog_histlen))
    {
        goto need_full_resync; // Perform full synchronization
    }

    // If the code runs to this point, it means that partial synchronization can be performed
    listAddNodeTail(server.slaves,c);

    // Return different CONTINUE responses according to whether the client is compatible with PSYNC2
    if (c->slave_capa & SLAVE_CAPA_PSYNC2) {
        buflen = snprintf(buf,sizeof(buf),"+CONTINUE %s\r\n", server.replid);
    } else {
        buflen = snprintf(buf,sizeof(buf),"+CONTINUE\r\n");
    }

    // The CONTINUE command is followed by the content of server.repl_backlog
    psync_len = addReplyReplicationBacklog(c,psync_offset);

    // ...

}
```

## Heartbeats & Command Propagation

Redis executes the timed task `replicationCron` once a second, which includes heartbeats between the master and slave. 
It can be found that the heartbeat frequencies of the master and slave are inconsistent:

```c
void replicationCron(void) {

    // The slave sends the REPLCONF ACK command to the master regularly
    if (server.masterhost && server.master &&
        !(server.master->flags & CLIENT_PRE_PSYNC)) {
        addReplyArrayLen(c,3);
        addReplyBulkCString(c,"REPLCONF");
        addReplyBulkCString(c,"ACK");
        addReplyBulkLongLong(c,c->reploff);
    }

    // The master sends the PING command to the slave regularly
    if ((replication_cron_loops % server.repl_ping_slave_period) == 0 &&
        listLength(server.slaves))
    {
        robj *ping_argv[1];
        ping_argv[0] = createStringObject("PING",4);
        replicationFeedSlaves(server.slaves, server.slaveseldb, ping_argv, 1);
        decrRefCount(ping_argv[0]);
    }
}
```
When the master `calls` the call function to execute the command passed by the client, it will propagate the command to the slave and write it to the replication backlog at the same time:

```c
void call(client *c, int flags) {
    // ...
    if (flags & CMD_CALL_PROPAGATE && (c->flags & CLIENT_PREVENT_PROP) != CLIENT_PREVENT_PROP)
    {
        // Does the current command need to be propagated?
        if (propagate_flags != PROPAGATE_NONE && !(c->cmd->flags & CMD_MODULE))
            propagate(c->cmd,c->db->id,c->argv,c->argc,propagate_flags);
    }
}

void propagate(struct redisCommand *cmd, int dbid, robj **argv, int argc,
               int flags)
{
    // ...
    if (flags & PROPAGATE_REPL)
        replicationFeedSlaves(server.slaves,dbid,argv,argc);
}

void replicationFeedSlaves(list *slaves, int dictid, robj **argv, int argc) {

    // If the current node does not have slave nodes or replication backlog, return immediately
    if (server.repl_backlog == NULL && listLength(slaves) == 0) return;

    // Write commands to repl_backlog in batches
    if (server.repl_backlog) {
        char aux[LONG_STR_SIZE+3]; // Command buffer for serializing Redis commands

        /* Write the number of commands in the current batch */
        aux[0] = '*';
        len = ll2string(aux+1,sizeof(aux)-1,argc);
        aux[len+1] = '\r';
        aux[len+2] = '\n';
        feedReplicationBacklog(aux,len+3);

        /* Iterate over the commands and write them to repl_backlog after serialization */
        for (j = 0; j < argc; j++) {
            long objlen = stringObjectLen(argv[j]);
            
            aux[0] = '$';
            len = ll2string(aux+1,sizeof(aux)-1,objlen);
            aux[len+1] = '\r';
            aux[len+2] = '\n';
            feedReplicationBacklog(aux,len+3);
            feedReplicationBacklogWithObject(argv[j]);
            feedReplicationBacklog(aux+len+1,2);
        }
    }

    // Propagate commands in batches to all clients corresponding to slaves
    listRewind(slaves,&li);
    while((ln = listNext(&li))) {
        client *slave = ln->value;

        /* Write the number of commands in the current batch */
        addReplyArrayLen(slave,argc);

        /* Iterate over the commands and propagate them to the slave node */
        for (j = 0; j < argc; j++)
            addReplyBulk(slave,argv[j]);
    }
}
```

## Relevant Configuration

### slave-serve-stale-data

How the slave responds to client requests when the master-slave connection is broken or synchronization is not complete:
- **yes**: Respond to commands normally, but do not guarantee data quality
- **no**: Refuse to respond to commands and return `SYNC with master in progress`


### repl-diskless-sync
How the master transfers the RDB snapshot to the slave when performing full synchronization:
- **no**: Generate RDB snapshot files on disk first and then transfer them (low bandwidth network)
- **yes**: Write the RDB snapshot directly to the slave's socket (low speed disk + high bandwidth network)


### repl-ping-slave-period
The interval at which the master sends the `PING` heartbeat to the slave, the default is 10 seconds.


### repl-backlog-size
The size of the replication backlog buffer, the default value is 1MB.

Since all commands will be backlogged here after the master-slave connection is broken, if this value is too small, the `PSYNC` command will not be able to perform partial synchronization.

If the master needs to execute a large number of write commands, or the slave takes a long time to reconnect successfully, you need to estimate it based on the actual situation.


### min-slaves-to-write & min-slaves-max-lag

When the following conditions are not met, the master will refuse to write commands until they are restored:

- **min-slaves-to-write** or more slave nodes connected to the current master are healthy
- At least **min-slaves-to-write** of the healthy slave nodes have a replication lag of less than **min-slaves-max-lag** seconds

With these two options enabled, write commands are more likely to be replicated to **min-slaves-to-write** slave nodes, reducing the likelihood of command loss.
