As a full-stack developer who knows a little about front-end, here is a brief review of what I have seen and heard in recent years as the beginning of this blog.

## jQuery: The Old King

Upon graduating, I joined an e-commerce company as a web application developer. 
The company was in its early stages, and everything seemed free-spirited, especially the technology stack.

At that time, the architect sneaked in some personal preferences, using the "full-featured online shopping system" he tinkered with in his spare time as the development template for all projects. 
As expected, an unexpected issue arose: during the first online flash sale, the system collapsed with less than 200 TPS...

Few months later, the company went under. While the boss suffered losses and I lost my job, the architect bought himself a luxury home in the city center. 
Checking his recent status, I discovered that the shopping system had been packaged into Software as a Service (SaaS), quietly waiting for the next victim.

As one of the victims of this system, I'll briefly share the frontend technology stack:
Since the project's development language was Java, all HTML pages were dynamically rendered through JSP.
 Additionally, the following two frontend frameworks were introduced on this basis:

### JQuery 
jQuery was released in 2006 as a fast and lightweight JavaScript library designed to simplify client-side scripting for HTML.
```js
(function($) { // Classic closure

  var hiddenBox = $( "#banner-message" ); // Event listening + DOM animation
  $( "#button-container button" ).on( "click", function( event ) {
    hiddenBox.show();
  });

  $.ajax({ // Ajax asynchronous communication
    url: "/api/getWeather",
    data: {
      zipcode: 97201
    },
    success: function( result ) {
      $( "#weather-temp" ).html( "<strong>" + result + "</strong> degrees" );
    }
  });

})(jQuery);
```

### Bootstrap

Bootstrap was released in 2011, providing a standardized set of CSS styles based on pre-defined class names. 
It is designed to create consistent user interfaces across multiple platforms.
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./css/bootstrap.min.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="row">
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Large</button> <!-- Blue regular-sized button -->
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-success btn-lg">Large</button> <!-- Green large-sized button -->
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-warning btn-sm">Small</button> <!-- Orange small-sized button -->
      </div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

The popularity of these two frameworks is closely related to the historical context of that time - browser compatibility. 
During that period, the HTML5 specification had not yet become widespread, and the support for this standard by most browsers was far from perfect. 
Developers had to deal not only with the new and somewhat unstable browsers like Firefox and Chrome, 
but also with the notorious IE due to its high market share on Windows.

In this era, both jQuery and Bootstrap not only provided out-of-the-box cross-browser compatibility but also offered numerous [polyfill](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Polyfill) plugins. 
These plugins enabled older browsers like IE to support some HTML5 features.
This significantly boosted development efficiency, leading many developers to embrace these frameworks.

## AngularJS: Origin Of Magic

Later on, I joined a logistics company, taking on the role of full-stack development for the internal management system. 
It was here that I first encountered the concept of frontend-backend separation and began learning about the NPM ecosystem.

During this period, my technical skills were relatively modest, but my enthusiasm for learning was soaring. 
Motivated by the promises from leadership, I utilized the Baidu Maps API to create an "Express Station Boundary Management System." 
This marked my first independently completed project in my professional career. 

Although I eventually left the company, I am sincerely grateful to my leaders and colleagues at the time.
I learned a great deal from them, and this experience holds a special place in my career journey.


### SPA 

As the HTML5 specification gained widespread support, compatibility ceased to be a critical issue in the frontend domain. 
The increasing demand for stringent user experiences became a new challenge for developers.

Among various factors, the most significant impact was on page refresh operations:

- Each page transition required a network request, and network communication latency affected the loading speed of pages.
- Resource files such as JS and CSS needed to be reloaded and initialized, further increasing the page rendering time.


To fundamentally address this issue, the design pattern known as Single Page Application (SPA) emerged. Its key features include:

- **Dynamic Loading:** SPAs initially load HTML, CSS, and JavaScript resources, dynamically updating content as users interact with the application.
- **Client-Side Routing:** SPAs use client-side routing to manage navigation within the application. URL changes dynamically based on user interactions, but the actual page doesn't reload.
- **Performance Improvement:** Since SPAs only fetch data needed to update the current view, they typically reduce the amount of data transferred between the client and server, thereby enhancing performance.

Applications using the SPA pattern have the following advantages:

- **Enhanced User Experience:** SPAs eliminate the delay of full-page reloads, providing a smoother and more engaging user experience.
- **Reduced Server Load:** SPAs request only necessary data, reducing the server load and optimizing bandwidth usage.
- **Frontend-Backend Separation:** Through API integration for frontend-backend separation and specialized technical team development, SPA applications further improve organizational development efficiency.

However, in the SPA pattern, the client needs to implement a considerable amount of complex DOM listening and modification logic. Taking the common example of submitting a form:
- Real-time monitoring of user modifications to the form, promptly notifying users of any errors.
- Disabling the submit button after the user clicks it to prevent duplicate submissions.
- Providing user feedback upon Ajax response, indicating successful operations, and clearing the form data.

```js
$(document).ready(function() {
  // Listen for user input
  $('#numberInput').on('input', function() {
    var inputValue = $(this).val();
    if ($.isNumeric(inputValue)) { // Validate the input
      $('button[type="submit"]').prop('disabled', false);
    } else {
      $('button[type="submit"]').prop('disabled', true);
    }
  });
  // Listen for form submission
  $('#myForm').submit(function(event) {
    var inputValue = $('#numberInput').val();
    if ($.isNumeric(inputValue)) {
      $.ajax({ // Initiate the request
          url: 'your_ajax_endpoint',
          type: 'POST',
          data: { number: inputValue },
          success: function(response) {
            $('#numberInput').val(''); // Clear the form
            alert('Ajax Request Successful');
          },
          error: function() {
            alert('An error occurred during the Ajax request');
          }
        });    
    } else {
      alert('Please enter a valid number');
    }
  });
});
```

Note: In a real-world scenario, where the form contains multiple fields and potential interdependencies, 
the code structure may need to be adapted to handle such complexity.

### AngularJS

In line with the trend of SPA, Google released a front-end JavaScript framework called AngularJS in 2010.
AngularJS, with its more declarative and expressive syntax, pioneered a new development paradigm, significantly improving the efficiency of SPA development.

AngularJS introduced two magical features:

- **Two-Way Data Binding:** AngularJS seamlessly connected models and views. Any changes to the model automatically reflected in the view, and vice versa.
- **Directives:** AngularJS extended HTML syntax, allowing the creation of custom and reusable components. These directives enhanced the structure and functionality of applications.

Below is a snippet of HTML code that can be directly executed.
Users do not need to write any JavaScript code; they can achieve interaction between DOM elements through directives:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.9/angular.min.js"></script>
  <body>
    <!-- ng-app 指令表示该 DOM 是 SPA 应用的根元素 -->
    <form ng-app="" name="myForm">
      <!-- ng-model 指令定义需要双向绑定的字段，可以同时指定校验条件 -->
      <p>Number : <input type="number" min="0" max="99" ng-model="numberInput"></p>
      <!-- ng-show 指令监听表单校验结果，并动态提示错误 -->
      <span ng-show="!myForm.$valid">Invalid number!</span>
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
```

Compared to jQuery, AngularJS provides a more concise implementation of DOM binding, and the interaction between elements is exceptionally smooth, significantly reducing repetitive template code. 
More importantly, AngularJS transforms traditional procedural programming into directive-based declarative programming, pioneering a new paradigm in front-end development.


## React: Efficiency First

Recently, I joined a digital finance company, responsible for managing historical data and gradually transitioning to pure backend development.

During a certain project, the company aimed to revitalize a massive volume of transaction details while meeting the needs of manual queries and compliance checks. 
I proposed an implementation based on HBase, requiring only 6TB of space to store 10 years of data.

Due to various reasons, big data operations and frontend resources were not adequately in place, so I had to handle the entire process myself. 
During this period, I began to explore the React ecosystem and developed a backend management system using AntDesign.

The emergence of React was to address the development challenges in increasingly complex user interaction scenarios, such as data visualization and online collaboration. 
Unlike traditional form applications, these scenarios face two new problems:

- **Complex State Management:** State changes are no longer a simple linear process; there is a need to manage dependencies and propagation between multiple change events.
- **Low Efficiency in DOM Node Rendering:** A single change event may trigger multiple DOM redraws, and frequent changes can consume a significant amount of browser resources.

To address these issues, Facebook introduced the React framework in 2013, characterized by the following features:

- **Unidirectional Data Flow:** Follows a unidirectional data flow, ensuring that data changes are handled predictably, avoiding the additional complexity introduced by bidirectional binding.
- **Declarative Syntax:** Provides a declarative syntax based on JSX templates. Developers only need to describe the desired result, and React efficiently updates the DOM.
- **Virtual DOM:** The virtual DOM is a lightweight replica of the real DOM. Incremental updates can be achieved by comparing the differences between the two, reducing unnecessary rendering.

Below is a snippet of HTML code that can be directly executed. 
The implementation might seem somewhat complex, but the flexibility of the syntax is a level above AngularJS:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/babel-standalone@6.26.0/babel.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@17.0.2/umd/react.development.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@17.0.2/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
    <script type="text/babel">

      // Define a functional component
      const MyForm = () => {
        
        // Declare state for input validation
        const [invalid, setInvalid] = React.useState(false) 
        
        // Validation function triggered on input change
        const validateInput = (e) => {
          const num = e.target.value
          setInvalid(!!e.target.value && (num < 0 || num > 99))
        }

        // JSX template for the form
        return (
          <form id="myForm">
            <p>Number :<input type="text" onChange={validateInput}/></p>
            {invalid && <span>Invalid number!</span>}
          </form>
        )
      }

      // Render the JSX component into the root div
      ReactDOM.render(<MyForm/>, document.getElementById('root'))

    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Nextjs: Renaissance

As time passes, I increasingly feel the importance of keeping records, leading to the idea of building a personal blog. 

The blog needs to meet the following requirements:
- Articles are written in Markdown, making it easy to switch front-end technology stacks.
- Construct a static resource site, beneficial for SEO, and reducing server costs.

After exploring few solutions, I found Next.js to be a good choice. 
After some tinkering, this article finally appears before you.


### SSR
While SPA can provide a decent user experience, this design pattern itself has some inherent drawbacks:

- **Slow Initial Loading:** Since all client-side logic is bundled into a bundle.js file, the initial load consumes a significant amount of time downloading and executing JS code, resulting in a prolonged blank screen.
- **Not SEO-Friendly:** All page content is dynamically rendered by the browser, which is not friendly to search engines that only parse static HTML. This affects website search rankings, hindering business promotion.

To address this issue, a batch of front-end solutions supporting Server-Side Rendering (SSR) emerged:

- Pre-rendering operations are performed on the server-side, reducing the rendering time required on the client-side. Unnecessary logic in the bundle.js file is compressed, improving page loading speed.
- Files returned to the client-side include complete HTML pages, making it easy for search engines to crawl and index content, beneficial for improving website search rankings.

### SSG
Similar to SSR, there is also a feature called Static Site Generation (SSG). 
SSG generates a set of static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files during the webpage building process. 
When a request is received, these files can be directly returned to the user without the need to render the page.

In comparison to SSR, SSG has two additional advantages:

- No need to render pages, reducing server load and providing faster loading times—a cost-effective and efficient solution.
- Static files can be easily distributed and cached on a CDN, ensuring the site's availability worldwide and offering faster access for global users.


### Nextjs

In the React ecosystem, the most popular SSR solution is Next.js. 
This framework simplifies the process of building server-rendered React applications and provides a set of conventions and tools to help developers focus on building application functionality rather than dealing with configuration.

Next.js supports both SSR and Static Site Generation (SSG) modes, with the main difference being the deployment environment:

- If a project requires SSR features, it must be deployed in a Node.js environment.
- If the project only includes SSG features, it can be deployed on any static server, such as Nginx.

In SSR mode, you need to implement the `getServerSideProps` function, which is called every time a user makes a request.
```jsx
import type { InferGetServerSidePropsType, GetServerSideProps } from 'next'
 
type Repo = {
  name: string
  stargazers_count: number
}
 
// Server-side function to fetch the star count of the next.js GitHub repository
export const getServerSideProps = (async (context) => {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js')
  const repo = await res.json()
  return { props: { repo } }
}) satisfies GetServerSideProps<{
  repo: Repo
}>
 
// Render the page based on the star count of the repository and return it to the client
export default function Page({
  repo,
}: InferGetServerSidePropsType<typeof getServerSideProps>) {
  return repo.stargazers_count
}
```

In the SSG mode, you need to implement the `getStaticProps` function, which is called only once during the page build process.
```jsx 
// Fetch the blog post list
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const res = await fetch('https://.../posts')
  const posts = await res.json()
  return {
    props: {
      posts,
    },
  }
}
// Generate a static page based on the blog post list
export default function Blog({ posts }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <li>{post.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

Additionally, Next.js provides the following important features:

- **Code Splitting:** It splits the globally unified entry file bundle.js into multiple chunk.js files. Each page only loads the JS code it requires.
- **Incremental Static Regeneration:** Allows individual static pages to be regenerated after the website is built. This enables updating specific static pages without rebuilding the entire website.
- **Image Loading Optimization:** It offers various commonly used features using the Image component, such as automatically generating multiple thumbnail sizes and preventing layout shifts during loading.


## The Way To The Future

In the process of writing this article, I experimented with generating sample code using ChatGPT, 
and the results were surprisingly good: the framework code produced by ChatGPT only required minor modifications to run.

The AI wave that began earlier this year has had a significant impact on the gaming industry and is gradually spreading to other sectors.
The recently released GPT-4 has the capability to convert images into HTML pages. This signifies that low-level programming could be replaced by AI in the not-too-distant future.


Many freelancers have already discovered numerous benefits from AI:
- Independent game developers using AI to replace graphic designers.
- Entrepreneurs using AI to create project proposals.
- Content creators using AI to generate articles.

As developers, it is essential to acknowledge the impact of AI and explore how to leverage it to improve development efficiency.
